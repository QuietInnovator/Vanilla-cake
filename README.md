# GPT4 Response: Classic Vanilla Cake Recipe
Classic Vanilla Cake Recipe

Ingredients:

Dry Ingredients:
2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
2 1/2 tsp baking powder
1/2 tsp salt
Wet Ingredients:
1 1/4 cups unsalted butter, softened
2 cups granulated sugar
4 large eggs
1 tsp pure vanilla extract
1 cup whole milk
Instructions:

Preparation:
Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).
Grease two 9-inch round cake pans or line them with parchment paper.
Mix Dry Ingredients:
In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.
Cream Butter and Sugar:
In a large bowl, using an electric mixer, cream together the softened butter and sugar until the mixture is light and fluffy. This should take about 3-4 minutes.
Add Eggs and Vanilla:
Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next.
Stir in the vanilla extract.
Alternate Dry Ingredients and Milk:
Begin by adding a third of the dry ingredient mixture to the butter and sugar mixture, mixing until just combined.
Pour in half of the milk, mixing again until just combined.
Repeat this process, ending with the dry ingredients. Ensure you're mixing just until combined each time to avoid overmixing.
Pour and Bake:
Evenly distribute the cake batter between the two prepared cake pans.
Place in the preheated oven and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cakes comes out clean.
Cool and Decorate:
Once baked, remove the cakes from the oven and allow them to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes.
Afterward, transfer the cakes onto a wire rack to cool completely.
Once cooled, you can frost and decorate as desired. A classic choice would be a vanilla buttercream or cream cheese frosting.
Tips:

For a richer flavor, you can add the zest of one lemon or orange to the batter.
If you'd like a chocolate version, replace 1/4 cup of the flour with unsweetened cocoa powder.
Always ensure your ingredients, especially butter and eggs, are at room temperature for best results.
Enjoy your homemade classic vanilla cake!
